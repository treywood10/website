abstract: Why do troop contributing countries differ in their contribution levels across missions? States that make contributions have the flexibility to select which missions their troops will join while retaining the authority to recall their troops. The literature notes that contributions are influenced by international and domestic factors, but it fails to explain how mission specific factors affect contributions. I argue that when mission mandates contain tasks that signal the potential for peacekeeper injury or death, states send smaller contributions to the risky mission, which is further exacerbated by increasingly dangerous conflict environments. Using the Tasks Assigned to Missions in their Mandates (TAMM) dataset, I find that states provide smaller contributions when mandates contain a large proportion of risky tasks, which becomes increasingly small as the conflict environment becomes more dangerous. This study demonstrates that states consider both mission mandates and conflict environments when contributing to United Nations peacekeeping operations.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Missions with high-risk mandates and dangerous implementation conditions experience smaller troop contributions.
