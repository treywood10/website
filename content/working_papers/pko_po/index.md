This project was one of the first quantitative research papers I wrote in graduate school. I created the project in my American Political Behavior seminar. Since I enjoyed peacekeeping and was not an American scholar, my professor allowed me to find a topic that aligned with my interests. Finding an interesting gap in the literature, I found that individuals who believe in the United Nations and value human rights prefer the United Nations to intervene in conflict situations. However, this relationship reverses when the individual comes from a country that previously experienced a peacekeeping mission. 

While not my best work in terms of theorizing and statistics, I enjoyed developing this work. I'll remember it as my first project that I actually enjoyed during graduate school.
