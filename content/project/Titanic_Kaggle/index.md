This project was one of the first Kaggle competitions I competed in after learning foundational knowledge in Python. The competition is a regression problem and asks competitors to predict the price of a home given a set of characteristics. In this project, I cleaned and transformed the data, utilized numerous machine-learning strategies, and predicted housing prices given a test set. I am currently updating this code locally, so this is not my current attempt. I hope to update the code and notebook soon!
